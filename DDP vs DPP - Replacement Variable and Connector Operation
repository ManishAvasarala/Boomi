The replacement variables and the request headers in the HTTP connector operation only work in combination with DDPs (Dynamic Document Property) and not DPP(Dynamic Process Property).
The best practice would be to use the Set Properties shape before the Connector to assign DDP values that will be used in the connector operation.
